To run the project locally, you need to set up the project carefully. Here are the steps:

**Local Setup:**

1. Clone Repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/subhadipbhowmik/30-Days-Of-CPP.git
    ```

2. Navigate to root directory:

    ```bash
    cd 30-Days-Of-CPP
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command installs all the necessary dependencies for the server. It reads the `package.json` file to determine what packages are needed, and then downloads them into a `node_modules` folder.

4. Run the project:
   
   ```bash
    npm start
    or,
    npm run start
    ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/30-Days-Of-CPP` to see the project running locally.
